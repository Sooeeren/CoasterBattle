🎢 Coaster-Battle 💥

    A thrilling "Higher or Lower" web game where you test your roller coaster knowledge!

Coaster-Battle is a simple yet addictive browser game that pits two random roller coasters against each other. Your goal is to guess whether the second coaster has a higher or lower value for a given stat—like speed, height, length, or even opening year! The game pulls real-time data from the extensive Roller Coaster DataBase (RCDB) via an API, ensuring endless variety and challenging comparisons.
